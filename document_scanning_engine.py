"""Implement a document scanning engine that receives a text document "doc" and returns a list
of all unique words in it and their number of occurrences, sorted by the number of occurrences
in descending order.

Example:
for doc: "practice makes perfect. get perfect by practice. just practice!"
the engine returns the list: { practice: 3, perfect: 2, makes: 1, get: 1, by: 1, just: 1 }.

The engine should ignore punctuation and white-spaces.
Find the minimal runtime complexity and analyze it."""
